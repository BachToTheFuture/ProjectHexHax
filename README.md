# AID PACT: Artificial Intelligence Derived Predictive Analysis of COVID-19 over Time
## Summary
Our interactive map displays current and AI-predicted future COVID-19 cases and unemployment rates over time. Using a Bayesian Ridge Regression, we trained our machine learning model by integrating Earth Observation derived features and socioeconomic data. By providing these location-based predictions, we hope to help the public make better-informed decisions regarding safety.
